# 209 Meal Prep

Static kitchen + ordering site. Customer menu is `New/index.html`. Kitchen board is `New/kitchen.html` (Menu, Recipes, Shopping, Orders).

## Browse (GitHub Pages)

After Pages is on (Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**), the kitchen board is:

**https://the209bbq.github.io/MealPrep/kitchen.html**

Recipes and Shopping are tabs on that page. The public menu is [index.html](https://the209bbq.github.io/MealPrep/). USDA lookups still work in the browser with a key saved on the device or `DEMO_KEY` — this deploy does not add API secrets. Free Pages needs a **public** repo (this one is private until you toggle visibility).

## Recipes (kitchen board)

The **Recipes** tab is part of the kitchen board — not a separate bot or CLI.

- Enter ingredients, costs, yields, and nutrition values on the same card-style layout as weekly menu controls
- USDA FoodData Central lookups attach cited sourced nutrition; your typed costs and overrides stay
- Every save/lookup is a durable record (origin, citation, timestamp)
- Export CSV + `.xlsx` for recipes, ingredients, input-vs-sourced nutrition, and records
- Menu tab **Edit recipe** opens that meal on Recipes

Public weekly menu and checkout are unchanged aside from extra macros when a recipe has them.

## API keys (do not commit secrets)

USDA FoodData Central needs a free [data.gov API key](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set USDA_FDC_API_KEY
node server.mjs
```

Or paste the key on the Recipes tab (this device only). Empty key tries USDA `DEMO_KEY` (rate limited).
